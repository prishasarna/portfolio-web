# Prisha Sarna's Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience as a Computing Science student at the University of Alberta.  The website is designed to resemble a stylized desktop environment, adding a touch of creativity and interactivity to the traditional portfolio format.

## Features

* **Interactive Desktop Design:**  The portfolio is built to look like a computer desktop, complete with folders, a taskbar, and decorative elements. This unique design adds visual interest and encourages exploration.
* **Dynamic Content Loading:**  Content for each "folder" (About Me, Projects, Skills, etc.) is loaded dynamically using JavaScript, creating a seamless user experience.
* **Animated Background:** The desktop "screen" features an animated background built using Three.js, adding depth and a modern feel.
* **Modal Windows:**  Clicking on folders opens modal windows to display the relevant content, keeping the interface clean and organized.
* **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:**  Provides the basic structure and content of the website.
* **CSS:**  Styles the website elements, creating the desktop aesthetic and animations.
* **JavaScript:**  Handles dynamic content loading, modal window functionality, and interactions.
* **Three.js:**  Used for creating the 3D animated background on the desktop screen.
* **Font Awesome:** Used for icons within the website.


## Folder Structure

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
* `style.css`: The stylesheet for the website.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file for dynamic functionality.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.


## Future Enhancements

* **More Interactive Elements:** Adding more interactive elements to the desktop environment, such as draggable icons or a functional clock.
* **Content Expansion:**  Adding more detailed project descriptions and potentially a blog section.
* **Improved Animations:** Refining the existing animations and potentially adding new ones.


This portfolio is constantly evolving, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it.  Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
